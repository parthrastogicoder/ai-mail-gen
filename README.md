# Bulk Email Sender with Personalized Content

This project is a bulk email sender built using Streamlit and LangChain's `ChatGroq` model to generate personalized emails for each recipient. The emails are tailored based on the client's name and the services they offer (e.g., E-commerce, Digital Marketing, etc.). This project supports reading data from a CSV file and sending emails using Gmail.

## Features

- **Personalized Email Generation:** Uses LangChain's ChatGroq model to dynamically generate email subject and body content.
- **Bulk Email Sending:** Sends emails using Gmail's SMTP server.
- **CSV Input:** Accepts a CSV file containing client data (Name, Email, Service) to send bulk emails.
- **Interactive UI:** A simple web interface built with Streamlit that provides real-time feedback.

## Thought Process & Approach

The project was developed under a tight time frame (1hr 30 mins) with the primary goal of demonstrating a full-stack, functional prototype. Key points in our thought process include:

- **Rapid Prototyping:**  
  The use of **Streamlit** allowed us to quickly build and iterate on the UI without complex frontend work.
  
- **AI Integration:**  
  Leveraging LangChain's **ChatGroq** model provided an efficient way to generate dynamic email content based on user prompts, reducing the need to write static templates.
  
- **Simplicity & Functionality:**  
  The design emphasizes core functionality—CSV upload, email generation, and email sending—without any unnecessary embellishments.
  
- **Security & Best Practices:**  
  Sensitive information (API keys and email credentials) is managed through environment variables and Streamlit's secrets management, ensuring that credentials are not exposed.

---

## Tech Stack & Rationale

- **Python:**  
  The project's backbone for its simplicity and extensive library support.

- **Streamlit:**  
  Chosen for its ease of creating interactive and rapidly deployable web applications. It allowed us to build a functional UI in minutes.

- **LangChain (ChatGroq):**  
  Provides a powerful integration for AI-driven content generation, enabling the dynamic creation of email content tailored to individual clients.

- **smtplib & Email Libraries:**  
  These built-in libraries in Python handle SMTP email sending seamlessly, allowing us to integrate Gmail for email distribution.

- **python-dotenv / Streamlit Secrets:**  
  Ensures environment variables (API keys, email credentials) are managed securely both in local development and in the deployed environment.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- A valid Gmail account with [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) enabled.
- A Groq API Key for ChatGroq model integration.
- Internet connection for API and email services.

---

## Setup & Local Development

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-mail-gen.git
   cd ai-mail-gen
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

   ```plaintext
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
   EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_gmail_address@gmail.com
   ```

   Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

5. **Run the Application**

   Launch the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This command should open your default browser at `http://localhost:8501` where you can interact with the app.

---

## Environment Variables

The project requires these environment variables:

- **GROQ_API_KEY:** Your Groq API key for the ChatGroq model.
- **EMAIL_PASSWORD:** Your Gmail app-specific password.
- **EMAIL_ADDRESS:** Your Gmail address used for sending emails.

These variables should be stored in a `.env` file (local development) or added through Streamlit's secrets management when deployed.

---

## Usage

1. **Upload CSV File:**  
   The app accepts a CSV file containing client data with at least the following columns:
   - `Name`: Client name
   - `Email`: Client email address
   - `Service`: Service being offered

2. **Generate Emails:**  
   After uploading the CSV, click on **Generate Email** to create personalized email content for each entry.

3. **Edit & Send:**  
   You can edit the generated email subject and body. Once satisfied, click **Send Email** to dispatch the messages.

4. **Feedback:**  
   The app provides real-time success or error messages to ensure that you are informed about the email sending process.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud. Follow the instructions below to deploy your own instance:

1. **Push Your Code to GitHub:**  
   Ensure that your repository is up-to-date and that sensitive files (like `.env`) are excluded using `.gitignore`.

2. **Configure Secrets on Streamlit Cloud:**  
   In your app's settings on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud), add the following secrets:

   ```toml
   [env]
   GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key"
   EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your_gmail_app_password"
   EMAIL_ADDRESS = "your_gmail_address@gmail.com"
   ```

3. **Deploy the App:**  
   Create a new app on Streamlit Community Cloud by connecting your GitHub repository. Set the main module to `app.py` (or your entry file) and deploy.

4. **Deployed App Link:**  
   You can access the deployed app at:  
   [https://ai-mail-gen-vyscmae8dozjnrs22ykkwr.streamlit.app/](https://ai-mail-gen-vyscmae8dozjnrs22ykkwr.streamlit.app/)
